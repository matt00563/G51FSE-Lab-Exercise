\section{Matt godfrey}
My strengths in this module is working well in a team. I have stong commnication and leadership qualities which enable the team to move forward in various tasks and keep everyone on track. It is also important to update people on eahc others progress and what tasks people in the groups are completing so we can estimate completion times etc...

One of my weaknesses would be to prepare myself with suitable subject knowledge before a task is to begin. For example, It would be better if I read around a particular program before the task begins so I could progress more quickly with this prior knowledge, which reduces the amount of time I would need to research a problem druring the project. 

me a paragraph about what you have learned in this module. You can write it in \textbf{Bold} if you want or you can use other fonts. 

Please do not forget:
\begin{itemize}
	\item First paragraph should have your comments about the module
	\item Second one, a selfie img with Max
	\item Last one, what you learned in this module.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comments about the module}

The best parts of the module would be the group tasks. I enjoy working collaboratively in a team which allows everyone to share skills and tips outside of required task. I think Max should walk nto the  lecture theatre with some form of entrance music. 

\subsection{Selfie with Max}

To include an image, you will need to remove the comments from the code below, place an image in the main folder, and do not forget to put the name of the image instead of ImgName. 

%\begin{figure}[h]
%\caption{Selfie with Max}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ImgName}
%\label{fig:selfie}
%\end{figure}

You can then use the label of the figure to reference it later with the command ${\backslash}ref.$ you can comment out the next line to see an example of how it works.

% My selfie with Max is in  Figure~\ref{fig:selfie}.

\subsection{What I have learned in this module}
